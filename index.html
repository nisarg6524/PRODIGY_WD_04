            <p>The know your mentor is designed to provide a user-friendly platform for students to anonymously submit 
                their feedback on various aspects of teaching, including but not limited to, clarity of instruction, 
                effectiveness of delivery, approachability, and overall satisfaction with the course. This 
                feedback is then compiled and presented to faculty members in a structured format, allowing 
                them to reflect on their strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
